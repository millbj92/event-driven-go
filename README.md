# Event Driven GO examples

Contained in this repo are various examples of event-driven development with Go.

I've tested them as much as I could, but there still may be some bugs here and there. Please create an issue if you spot one! 

I'd like to hopefully keep a repository of examples/starter templates for event-driven dev to help newcomers to this technique (like myself), get started!
